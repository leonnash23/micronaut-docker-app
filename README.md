# micronaut-docker-app

This is a sample app with Micronaut. I used the DI and HTTP Server from this framework.

You can build project, pack to docker image and run the image by `./restart.sh`

Go to the browser:
* At `localhost` - welcome page and server timestamp
* At `localhont/days` - form for calculating days between two dates
